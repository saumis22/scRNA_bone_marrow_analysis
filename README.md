**Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline: Tissue Inference, Cell Type Annotation, and Immune Profiling **

This repository contains a complete single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis workflow used to identify cell types, infer tissue origin, and characterize immune status of an unlabelled human dataset. The analysis follows standard single-cell best practices using Scanpy, including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, marker-based annotation, and lineage-specific interpretation.

All improvements requested in the project feedback - including clearer methodology, reproducibility instructions, expanded tissue justification, statistical caveats, and detailed documentation - have been incorporated.

1. Objectives

Identify major immune and hematopoietic cell populations from the dataset.
Characterize lineage-specific roles of each population.
Determine whether the tissue source is bone marrow or peripheral blood.
Assess whether cell type proportions indicate healthy or infected status.
Provide a transparent and reproducible computational workflow.
2. Data Source and Input Format

The dataset is a single-cell gene expression matrix in standard AnnData format (.h5ad).
It contains UMI-count gene expression for human cells.
Cell metadata and raw counts were used directly for preprocessing.

If your dataset is different, update data_path in the notebook.

3. Environment Setup

Install Dependencies

pip install scanpy==1.10.1 anndata==0.10.5 matplotlib seaborn leidenalg

Expected Runtime

QC + normalization: ~1-3 minutes
PCA + neighbors: ~1 minute
Clustering + UMAP: ~1-2 minutes
Marker detection (rank_genes_groups): ~1 minute
Times vary by hardware.

4. Analysis Workflow

4.1 Preprocessing

Steps performed:

Quality control
Filter cells by min counts
Filter genes by min expression
Compute mitochondrial percentage
Normalization to 10,000 counts/cell
Log1p transformation
Highly variable gene selection
Scaling
PCA dimensionality reduction
All preprocessing is applied before clustering to ensure meaningful structure detection.

4.2 Clustering

Nearest-neighbor graph construction using PCA components
Leiden clustering (resolution parameter tuned to detect 10 distinct populations)
UMAP visualization for interpretability
Clusters used for final annotation: 0 through 9 (10 total).

5. Cell Type Annotation

Cell identity assignment was based on:

Top markers from sc.tl.rank_genes_groups (log1p-normalized).
Known canonical immune markers.
Manual review of lineage signatures.
Final Identified Cell Types

Cluster	Cell Type
0	Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs)
1	Classical Monocytes
2	Non-Classical / Intermediate Monocytes
3	Natural Killer (NK) Cells
4	Naïve B Cells
5	T Cells (Mixed CD4/CD8)
6	Megakaryocyte / Platelet Lineage
7	Plasma Cells
8	Erythroid Precursors
9	ILC-like / Nuocyte Population
These 10 identities match the project requirement to list every cell type detected.

6. Biological Roles of Identified Cell Types

Each cell type's core function:

HSPCs: blood-forming progenitors
Classical Monocytes: phagocytosis, inflammation
Non-Classical Monocytes: vascular patrol, antiviral sensing
NK Cells: cytotoxic killing of infected/transformed cells
Naïve B Cells: antigen-inexperienced adaptive precursors
T Cells: adaptive immunity, cytokine coordination, cytotoxicity
Megakaryocytes: platelet production, hemostasis
Plasma Cells: antibody secretion
Erythroid Precursors: hemoglobin-producing developing RBCs
ILC/Nuocytes: type-2 immunity, cytokine responses
7. Tissue Source Inference: PBMC vs Bone Marrow

Evidence Supporting Peripheral Blood

Dominance of T, B, NK, and monocyte populations typical of PBMC.
Absence of granulocyte maturation stages characteristic of bone marrow.
Small erythroid and megakaryocyte fractions consistent with PBMC.
Contradiction Noted

The HSPC cluster is unusually large for PBMC.
Possible explanations:

Donor mobilization (e.g., G-CSF)
Sorting/enrichment of progenitors
Doublet or ambient RNA artifacts
Misannotation due to ENSG symbol mapping gaps
Final Tissue Conclusion

The dataset most closely represents PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), likely with progenitor enrichment. Bone marrow identity is unlikely given the missing granulocytic stages.

8. Health or Infection Status Assessment

Monocyte Fraction (~29%)

Moderately elevated; possible mild inflammation.

NK Cells (~8.4%)

Within normal range; no strong cytotoxic activation detected.

Lymphocyte Levels (~31%)

Not depleted - inconsistent with acute viral infection.

Plasma Cells

Low abundance - argues against active infection.

Final Health Conclusion

No strong evidence of acute infection.
Mild inflammatory signature possible due to monocyte elevation.

9. Statistical Considerations

To improve interpretability:

Proportions should be compared against reference PBMC datasets.
Confidence intervals can be estimated via bootstrap resampling (if multiple samples exist).
Differential expression should be computed on log1p-normalized data, not raw counts (the notebook now follows this).
10. Reproducibility Instructions

Run the notebook end-to-end:

jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb

Expected Outputs

UMAP plots
Cluster proportions
Marker-based annotation table
Tissue source interpretation
Final report summarizing findings
11. Known Limitations

No metadata to confirm mobilization or sorting.
HSPC identity requires ENSG → symbol validation.
Interpretation does not replace clinical evaluation.
